    "\n",
    "You can think of an object as a collection of named values and functions that make use of those values. When they are part of an object, we call them **attributes** and **methods**. Each object is created from a **class**, or object template. Examples of classes you have used include the `pandas DataFrame` and `xarray DataArray`. As an example, `xr.DataArray` includes attributes like `.values`, and methods like `.mean()`. It also contains some special attributes created when the function is initialized for each of the coordinates (e.g. `x` and `y` if your `DataArray` has those as coordinates).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can absolutely write a reproducible scientific workflow without writing any of your own classes. However, there are some situations where custom classes can come in handy. Consider the following examples:\n",
    "  * Suppose you are writing code to interface with an API. There are going to be multiple steps, such as logging in, searching for data, and downloading data. Throughout the whole interaction, you want to keep track of the dates and bounding box for the data -- and you might even want to access those values after the data are completely downloaded! If you write a function, you'll run into two problems: 1) the function will be very long, 2) the function may take a long time to run, making it challenging to debug and text, and 3) you'll lose all the named values you define inside the function when it finishes running unless you pass them explicitely as return values. Using a class solves all these problems. You can split up the different parts of the workflow into shorter methods that all have access to the same information, such as bounding box or HTTP Session information.\n",
    "  * Suppose you are assembling a data cube (aligned and harmonized data from heterogeneous sources). Eventually, you will have a single `xarray DataArray` or `Dataset`. However, in the meantime you need to keep track of many data files such that you can access them by name, by attribute, or by order. Often we use the `pandas DataFrame` for this type of thing. However, it would be nice if the `DataFrame` did a couple of things differently. For example, when it prints you would like it to display the bounding box of each DataArray instead of the array itself (which is computationally expensive). Or, maybe when you create the DataFrame you would like it to search for all file names that match a pattern and extract key information. You can accomplish these goals by creating a **child** class to `pandas DataFrame` that inherits all its capabilities and modifies its methods, perhaps adding some new ones.\n",

    "2. **Fit a model:** For each grassland:\n",
    "    1. **Download model variables** as raster layers covering your study area envelope, including:\n",
    "        - At least one **soil** variable from the [POLARIS dataset](http://hydrology.cee.duke.edu/POLARIS/)\n",
    "        - Elevation from the SRTM (available from the [APPEEARS API](https://appeears.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/products))\n",
    "        - The **30 year periods** of precipitation and temperature from the [MACAv2 dataset, accessible from Climate Toolbox](https://climatetoolbox.org/tool/Data-Download). Include an arrangement of emissions scenarios and time periods, following the guidelines above.\n",
    "     2. **Calculate at least one derived **topographic** variable** (slope or aspect) to use in your model. You probably will wish to use the `xarray-spatial` library, which is available in the latest earth-analytics-python environment (but will need to be installed/updated if you are working on your own machine). Note that calculated slope may not be correct if you are using a CRS with units of *degrees*; you should re-project into a projected coordinate system with units of *meters*, such as the appropriate UTM Zone.\n",
    "     3. **Harmonize your data** - make sure that the grids for each of your layers match up. Check out the [`ds.rio.reproject_match()` method](https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray/stable/examples/reproject_match.html#Reproject-Match) from `rioxarray`.\n",
    "     4. **Build your model**. You can use any model you wish, so long as you explain your choice. However, if you are not sure what to do, we recommend building a **fuzzy logic** model (see below).\n",
